# Zurb Foundation Read Me
#### This read me is based on Railscast episode #417

The store app I created is based on resources from both the Railscast episode 417 and also the Zurb Foundation documentation, which I will continue to review as much as possible so that I can utilize Zurb at a higher level.

In using Zurb, I hope to gain a better understanding of the following:

* Sass

* The CSS grid system

* Ways to build more efficient apps in connection with Ruby on Rails

This store app I created includes ways for a consumer to create, update and delete a product.

<b>Question:</b> How can I use scaffolding to build a more customized app? While all scaffolding includes the ability to Create, Update and Destroy, how can I use it to build a more customized app that fits the needs of my objective? Is it more beneficial to scaffold or create an app from scratch (since the extraneous files scaffolding uses doesn't exist already)?
